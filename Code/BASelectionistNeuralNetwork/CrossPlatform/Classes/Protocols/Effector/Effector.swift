// Effector 
//
// Noun: person or thing that "brings about", "implements", 
//       or "effects" an action. Something that is effective, versus
//       merely influential, in a process.
//
// Effectors are the output transducers for the neural network. 
//
// Internally the activation level signals among neurons are scaled values
// in the 0...1 range (i.e., class Scaled0to1Value). Outputs "in the real
// world" are likely to be some other type of data, or an action. It is the job
// of the Effector to translate from the internal scaled activation level
// to whatever is necessary to effect the "motor" action to be controlled by the
// motor neuron.
//
// prepareActivation() latches the activation level from the motor output 
// neuron. Internally this value remains the same even if the activation level
// of the motor neuron changes.
//
// commitActivation() pushes the previously motor neuron activation level to the
// activationLevel attribute of the effector. It is at this point that an effector
// tied to an external system would be operated (e.g., step a stepper motor).
//
// resetActivation() returns the internal activation level to whatever its base
// level is. Note that this base level will not get pushed to the activationLevel
// attribute, and therefore, external systems, until commitActivation() is called.
//

    // prepareActivation() method is called.

    // Require initialization. If you will want to look up the effector
    // using the Network's findNode() interface, provide an identifier. If
    // not, then leave it nil to save space (most nodes in the neural network
    // are unnamed).
